		There really isn't much I can remember from my childhood, not until 6.<sup>1</sup> The earliest memory fragment I can remember was when I was 2yrs old.<sup>2</sup> It's the time where I am at some arcade game place with my father.<sup>3</sup> The reason I know how I am 2yrs old is because there is a picture of it and I asked my parents how old I am at that time.<sup>4</sup> Although I don't know how old I am, I can still vividly remember that scene from my memory.<sup>5</sup> After that memory fragment, the next thing I remember is when I am at pre-school grade level at Angel's Home School near my house.<sup>6</sup> I was quite the unruly kid back then.<sup>7</sup> Not unruly in a bad way but in terms of playfulness.<sup>8</sup> Due to that my parents decided to have me learn taekwondo.<sup>9</sup> I don't know back then why, but I guess it has something to do with quelling my overflowing energy and to teach me discipline at the same time.<sup>10</sup> Although it didn't work much if I say so myself, as I am still quite the somewhat problem kid, it still has given me something which is maybe, knowing what is right from wrong and the ability to restrain when needed.<sup>11</sup> Like for example, when I made someone cry for some unknown reason, I would immediately stop as I think I have done something wrong and also apologize afterwards and be friends again.<sup>12</sup> It doesn't make sense to me back then but I guess it's still good.<sup>13</sup> Because when I see kids today, they don't know what restraint is.<sup>14</sup> They just do whatever they want and if they know they're at fault they don't apologize but instead run or hide or worst, shift the blame.<sup>15</sup> With that in mind, I'm thankful I have a great parents that teaches me discipline and values that I will take until I die.<sup>16</sup> Apart from that, my elementary days was quite good too.<sup>17</sup> I always got honors from grade 1 until grade 6.<sup>18</sup> With top 2 in Grade 1 and Grade 4 and Top 3 in Grade 6.<sup>19</sup> At grade 6, I was scouted by my PE teacher to join Volleyball, Badminton, and Basketball match for intrams between school near our district.<sup>20</sup> Although we didn't get the championship as the opponent is really trained unlike ours which is makeshift, we still won some and that's quite joyful thing to celebrate.<sup>210</sup> And what's more joyful is that every after game, our teacher treats us to Jollibee.<sup>22</sup> I guess I have a pretty good childhood experience.<sup>23</sup>

		Now, this is the best time of my life.<sup>1</sup> I experienced many kinds of emotion in this time of my life.<sup>2</sup> Or maybe in other words, what I call basic 7 deadly sins and its counterparts of course.<sup>3</sup> First, I took Junior High School at St. Joseph School, Gagalangin.<sup>4</sup> I wanted to go there not only because my brother was an alumni there, but also because it's the nearest one as it's just 3-5min walk trip.<sup>5</sup> Going back to why I said basic 7 deadly sins, it's because although I did those feelings, it isn't to the point of no return.<sup>6</sup> Lust because of puberty hitting.<sup>7</sup> Wrath or anger towards rules that restrict my movement back then such as not being able to go outside once we're inside the premises of the school.<sup>8</sup> Also towards my friends when left me out for a while.<sup>9</sup> Pride because I think too highly of my intelligence that I didn't study much.<sup>10</sup> Envy because of the tools/gadgets I have seen from my classmates then which I cannot have.<sup>11</sup> Greed because I wanted high scores so much that I cheated and wanting to have my crush only my crush.<sup>12</sup> And lastly, Gluttony and Sloth which are the one who affected me the most because I like to eat so much that I became obese until now and because I don't want to work back then as I think that I should enjoy myself in this time of my life.<sup>13</sup> Although these feelings isn't a good thing to have.<sup>14</sup> It didn't last much either maybe because I'm in Catholic school and my upbringing I got from my parents is good.<sup>15</sup> I quelled my lust or desire and protected my chastity and got self control because of one sentence my Teacher said to us "The greatest gift you can give towards your future spouse or love ones is your purity/chastity".<sup>16</sup> Overall, after I graduated I have learned how to be patient.<sup>17</sup> Learned how being complacent isn't a good thing as it becomes a habit.<sup>18</sup> Learned how to prioritize things I need than ones I want.<sup>19</sup> Know what one should do and should not.<sup>20</sup> Basically, apart from sloth and gluttony, I pretty much solved them through the teachings of my parents and the school.<sup>21</sup> Apart from emotions I have experienced back then, I have met quite few good friends which I still have contact with.<sup>22</sup> In conclusion, I guess this time of my life is the best one so far as I have felt and experienced many things.<sup>23</sup>

		First and foremost, what I can say about college in one word is Exhausting.<sup>1</sup> This is what I felt ever since I stepped on College.<sup>2</sup> At first, it was okay because the task are still easy and manageable.<sup>3</sup> As time goes by however, it became harder and harder.<sup>4</sup> The deadlines must be met.<sup>5</sup> The school time/schedule is kind of long and going home late at night during traffic takes too much time.<sup>6</sup> With that, I don't even know if I have enough time to pass requirements required for tomorrows subject.<sup>7</sup> You could also say that all I've done in my college years is complain.<sup>8</sup> Although I complain I still does it because I know, somehow or someday it will help me.<sup>9</sup> Some also says that the reason we are being task always and repeatedly is to make us get used to it because they said that it's like that at real work in society.<sup>10</sup> So I just gritted my teeth keep calm and just do it.<sup>11</sup> In spite of that hardships, I still met some wonderful friends.<sup>12</sup> Although I pretty much teased or laugh at them when they're angry, we still became good friends.<sup>13</sup> During this time of my life, I learned how to manage my schedule.<sup>14</sup> Set priories to be done first.<sup>15</sup> After that would be other smaller priorities and then play all day long to release stress.<sup>16</sup> You can say that playing games is also my stress reliever as well as reading manga/novels and watching anime/movies.<sup>17</sup> College years or 'my' college years could be said time restricted.<sup>18</sup> I need to manage it well or else I'll suffer not getting enough sleep.<sup>19</sup> With pandemic suddenly arriving and all, It became much more harder in terms of learning especially when it's best to learn something by doing it physically.<sup>20</sup> In conclusion, I'm close to giving up but still need reason to so it's kind of manageable also.<sup>21</sup> I hope I got through this and achieve my goal.<sup>22</sup>
