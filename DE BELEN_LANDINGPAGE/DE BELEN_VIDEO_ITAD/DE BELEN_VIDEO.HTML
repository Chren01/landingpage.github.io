	<p>On the right side, we have a clip of two of the best fighting scene in <i><b>King Arthur: The Legend of the Sword</b></i>, is an epic fantasy action adventure film directed by Guy Ritchie who co-wrote the film with Joby Harold and Lionel Wigram from a story by Harold and David Dobkin, inspired by Arthurian legends. This movie was so great both in terms story and action scene. Sadly it is underated movie because of the fans of original written King Arthur story. They critized that that's not how the story flows and they want it to follow the real story, which in turn wouldn't be in the category of epic fantasy action movie. It was such a great movie, such a shame that the fans of the original story isn't flexible enough.</p>
	
	<p>On the left side, we have trailer of <i><b>Frozen 2</b></i>, continuation of the first Disney Movie, Frozen. It is a fantasy 3D movie that is highly computer generated and has a great graphic details that it's as if it's a real human movie if you're gonna exclude the size of the eyes. There are many Disney Movies that I have liked but this one is the that I like the most.</p>

It is based on the book series of the same name by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski. The witcher named <i><b>Geralt</b></i>, a mutated monster hunter, struggles to find his place because of the discrimination in a world in which people often prove more wicked than beasts. Witchers are once-normal humans who got mutated by a combination of medieval science and magic, which made them superhuman, which in turns makes them more suitable to be a monster hunter in a world where monster roams and commits disturbance anywhere.</p>
